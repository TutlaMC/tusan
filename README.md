Ever tried to make a Discord Bot but those wierd documentations and paid bot makers kept getting in your way? TuSK lets you create "skripts" (which is unebelievably easy to learn, its almost like English!) that lets you make bots. 

Wait wait wait... before you click away, see why TuSK is better than its competitors

# Why is it better than x?

| X                      | Problem & Advanatage                           | Tusk Alternative
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| BotGhost               | Limits you to paid options but easier to learn | Free to use, infinitely customizable |
| BotDesignerForDiscord  | Pay to host, but similar to TuSK in features   | BDFD is very similar to TuSK but TuSK is open source and lets you capture output from external sources and post/get data from databases, TuSK also has a much better learning curve |
| discord.js/discord.py  | Hard to learn/setup but offers MUCH more features than TuSK | `shell capture "python3 idea.py` is always there for you |
| chatgpt/ai             | Screws you sometimes but of course you can build so much with it | Use ChatGPT with TuSK (coming soon) |
